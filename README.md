# Principles-Project
Open "sudoku1.html" to view the login page, where previous Sudoku users will be able to login to their accounts.
They will be able to do so by entering there usernames and passwords.
When a new user visits the Sudoku application, they can click on the 'sign up' button.
This prompt will then direct the new user to "sudoku2.html" to view the sign up page where new users can create their accounts.
They will have to input their first name, last name, user name and password. 
If a user is successful with their login, they will be taken to a page that notifies the user that they are successful and proceeds to the game page.
If a user is unsuccessful with their login they will be taken to a page that notifies the user that they are unsuccessful and takes them back to the login.
The game will be shown on "sudoku3.html" where there is a 9x9 game board, with a new game option and load game option.
There is also a drop down list, that allows the user to select their preferred difficulty.
